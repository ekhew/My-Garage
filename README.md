# My Garage
This program allows the user to create vehicle objects, such as cars, motocycles, and trucks, and then store them in a garage array.
## Motivation
This project was created as a way for me to practice object oriented programming in C++. 
## Features
- Adding and removing vehicles
- Swapping out a vehicle in the garage for a new one that is not in the garage
- Checking if garage is full
- Display all vehicles currently in the garage
